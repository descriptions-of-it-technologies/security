## Cross-Site Request Forgery:
* A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack is when a site tricks the userâ€™s web browser to send a request to a site 
  where the user is authenticated
* CSRF attacks work because the browser is tricked into sending session cookies to the trusted site
* Thus, the trusted site cannot distinguish the request is not from the authenticated user





## CSRF - Synchronizer Token Pattern:
* The Synchronizer Token Pattern requires in addition to the session cookie, a secure random CSRF token must be in request
* CRSF Token must be part of HTTP Request not automatically sent by browser
  * Do not store CRSF token in cookies
  * Use:
    * HTTP Headers
    * Hidden Form Fields





## SameSite Cookie Attribute:
* The SameSite cookie attribute can be set to tell browser to not send cookie when request is coming from other sites
* SameSite cookie attribute is supported on all modern browsers, older browsers might not support
* Supports - None, Lax (~subdomain), Strict
* Modern browsers transitioning from None to Lax if not explicitly set.
* Should not solely rely on SameSite attribute for CSRF prevention





## When to Use CSRF Protection?
* Spring Security Team recommends:
* Use CRSF when requests are processed by a browser by normal users.
* ie - HTML, Single page apps (Angular, React, etc)
* If only used by non-browser clients, disable CSRF
* ie - programatic clients, like Spring RestTemplate or WebClient
